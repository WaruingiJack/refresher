Quick refresher guide

Been a while since I used git so I got a little bit rusty so I decided to do a quick refresher for some interviews coming along. 
I don't think I've forgotten much but I want the interview to be perfect so I will pretty much be redundant in my revision.
Repetition breeds muscle memory and that can't be a bad thing.
